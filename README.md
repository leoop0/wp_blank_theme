# wp_blank_theme

This theme is a starter theme for Wordpress.

It has no content except SCSS for grids and flexboxes.

I thought this theme to be used with the [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) extension from VS Code, but you can also simply remove the SCSS files and modify the CSS.

Juste run this command into your Terminal to clone the project in the desired folder :

`git clone -m https://github.com/leoop0/wp_blank_theme.git`
